# Machine-Learning
machine learning small projects</br>
First Project- building decision Trees (Classifier and Regressor) 
              , adaboost and Gradient boost from scratch in python 
              I got RANK 3 in terms of peformance (models Accuracy and time complexity)
              competing against 50+ groups
Second and Third Project - applying machine learning algorithms to a dataset 
                          (includes visulazation, data pre-processing and
                          predictions)
done 95% of the work by myself.
