# Machine-Learning
machine learning small projects</br>
First Project- building decision Trees (Classifier and Regressor) </br>
              , adaboost and Gradient boost from scratch in python </br>
              I got RANK 3 in terms of peformance (models Accuracy and time complexity)</br>
              competing against 50+ groups</br>
Second and Third Project - applying machine learning algorithms to a dataset </br>
                          (includes visulazation, data pre-processing and</br>
                          predictions)</br>
done 95% of the work by myself.</br>
average grades: 106/100
